# Multitrajectory Clustering

## Overview
This project simulates multiple trajectories on a 2D map, where points move along predefined curving
paths. The main goal is to create a model that can analyze the movement of these points to identify
common paths (roads) and estimate values such as throughput, bandwidth, and traffic intensity.

## Features
- Generation of curving paths using cubic splines.
- Random distribution of points along the paths with varying speeds.
- Real-time simulation and visualization of traffic movement.
- Customizable parameters for the number of paths, points, speeds, and path characteristics.
